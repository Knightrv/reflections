It saved lots of time and it made the task easy .                                                         It can be useful to remove bugs or typo in my updated code and save my time by just comparing with the previous saved versions.                                        PROS:It gives flexibility and options to the users to take their decision when to commit and save version.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          CONS:Sometimes user can forget to commit  for a long time and in that case it becomes a trouble to retype the change and find bugs if any.                                                           by typing only once instead of typing each time on a new file and as a result it saves a lot of time of the user.                                                         working on that repository and git diff command is used to compare changes made in any two commits.                      because we always have the choice to go to the previous commit and undo the changes.
